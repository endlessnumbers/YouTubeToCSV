<b>YouTube to CSV</b>

Instructions

The program will prompt the user to enter a channel URL - just go to their page and copy and paste the link into the program and press enter.

The program works by opening each page in a Google Chrome window automatically and parsing the results. Once the Chrome window opens, you may need to click a "Consent" button, but once this is done the program will continue by itself - you can minimise Chrome (don't close it though!) and do something else at this point. The Chrome window that opens will be automatically muted, and progress can be monitored in the console window.
